# SQL Advent Calendar 🎄

This repository contains my complete solutions to the **SQL Advent Calendar challenge by Interview Master**. Over 24 days, I solved one SQL problem per day, covering a wide range of SQL concepts commonly used in analytics work and technical interviews.

All solutions are packaged together in a single ZIP file for easy download and review.

**All SQL solutions (Days 1–24):**
`sql-advent-calendar-nimishashah.zip`

The ZIP file contains the full set of daily SQL queries, organized by day, with each file corresponding to one challenge.

## What this project covers

Throughout the challenge, I worked on problems involving:

* Data filtering and sorting
* Aggregations and grouping
* Joins across multiple tables
* Window functions (ranking, running totals, comparisons over time)
* Date and time calculations
* Conditional logic using `CASE`
* Subqueries and CTEs

The difficulty increases gradually, making this a strong representation of practical SQL problem-solving.

## Why I did this

I completed this challenge to:

* Build a consistent daily SQL practice habit
* Improve clarity and structure in writing SQL queries
* Practice real-world problem scenarios rather than isolated syntax

This repository now serves as both a learning log and a reference for SQL interview preparation.
